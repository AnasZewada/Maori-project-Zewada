# Maori-project-Zewada

I chose to make my website about the Egyptian national football team- also known as the Pharoahs-because I am egyptian and I wanted other's to know about our football team.

I chose the red and black wavy backround with the puma loga and team logo because it is directly related to the topic and it is eyecatching
